2. Why can't you connect to GitHub?

Please check your network connection to ensure it is stable and functional.

If you are still unable to connect, you can press F12 to check for error messages. For example, you may encounter an error message like the one below.

If you encounter a 503 error, one possible reason could be that you have revoked GitHub authorization on the following interface, as shown in the screenshot below

If you encounter a similar situation, we recommend clicking on "Disconnect" on the following page and then requesting authorization from GitHub again.

3. I'm a team member, and I can't find the submission portal for competition materials?


Regular team members do not have the authority to submit or modify project materials. Only the team leader has the permission to do so.
